Blue Lock tops the best-selling manga list for the first half of 2023.


As we cross into the year's second half, Oricon has published the manga sales ranking for the first half of 2023. All listed series are in serialization or have been serialized. Taking into consideration the popularity of these listed series, it is no wonder why each has a manga adaptation.  

Oricon's manga sale rankings from the first half of 2023 are as follows:
1. Blue Lock (8,046,032 copies)
2. Chainsaw Man (4,492,906 copies)
3. Slam Dunk (4,199,966 copies)
4. Jujutsu Kaisen (3,757,215 copies)
5. One Piece (3,550,097 copies)
6. Spy X Family (2,688,171 copies)
7. Tokyo Revengers (2,622,078 copies)
8. My Hero Academy (1,887,507 copies)
9. Oshi no Ko (1,690,722 copies)
10. Kingdom (1,569,434 copies)

The revival of Slam Dunk's popularity is likely a result of The First Slam Dunk releasing in theaters near the end of December 2022.
Many people enjoyed the film. The film surpassed 8 billion yen (~55 million USD) in sales and received a nomination during the 46th Japan Academy Film Prize. Chainsaw Man, Blue Lock, and Oshi no Ko are also likely to receive boosts from their anime productions continuing in 2023.

You can order digital and physical copies from all of the Weekly Shonen Jump series listed above at the VIZ website using this link. By the way, the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen will begin on July 6th, 2023.

Notes

8 billion Japanese yen is approximately 55 million dollars at the time of writing.
The localized name of 日本アカデミー賞 is Japan Academy Film Prize.
