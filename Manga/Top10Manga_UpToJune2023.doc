Blue Lock tops the best-selling manga list for the first half of 2023.


As we cross into the second half of the year, Oricon has published the manga sales ranking of 2023, up until June. All listed series are in serialization.

Oricon's first 2023 first-half manga sales rankings are the following:
1. Blue Lock (8,046,032 copies)
2. Chainsaw Man (4,492,906 copies)
3. Slam Dunk (4,199,966 copies)
4. Jujutsu Kaisen (3,757,215 copies)

9. Oshi no Ko (1,690,722 copies)
10. Kingdom (1,569,434 copies)

The revival of Slam Dunk's popularity is likely a result of The First Slam Dunk releasing in theaters near the end of December 2022.
Many people enjoyed the film. Not only did the film surpass 8 billion yen　(~55 million USD) in sales, but it received a nomination for the 46th Japan Academy Film Prize. Chainsaw Man, Blue Lock, and Oshi no Ko are also likely to receive boosts from their continued anime productions in 2023.
