Using AI to create a new story for the Black Jack manga


The Black Jack manga stars Black Jack, a genius doctor who does not have a medical license. The late Osamu Tezuka began writing this manga 50 years ago.

Osamu Tezuka's oldest son, Makoto, presented this project at Keio University, where AI was used to create a new Black Jack story.

This new comic is a collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence. 
Humans map out the story and theme of Black Jack, while AI creates the general outline.
The AI being used in the project can draw many things, such as character faces. It also studies other manga created by Osamu Tezuka.

This project will examine just how close AI can get to replicating human ideas and amusement. 

According to Tezuka Productions, this new story created with AI will be published in a manga magazine this coming fall.


Notes
Manga are comic books from Japan
