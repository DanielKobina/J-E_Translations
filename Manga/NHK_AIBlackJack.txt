Using AI to create a new story for the Black Jack manga

The Black Jack manga stars Black Jack, a genius doctor that does not have a medical license. 
The late Osamu Tezuka began writing this manga 50 years ago.

Osamu Tezuka's oldest son, Makoto, presented this project where AI was used to create a new Black Jack story at Keio University.

This new manga story is created in collaboration with humans and artificial intelligence. 
Humans teach the story and theme of Black Jack, while AI creates the outline.
This AI being used can draw various things such as character faces.
This AI also studies other manga created by Osamu Tezuka.

With this project, we can study just how close AI can get to replicating human ideas and interests.

According to Tezuka Productions, this new story created with AI will be published in a manga magazine this coming fall.



Notes
manga: comics books from Japan
