Japan's Environmental Ministry "The concentration of tritium in Fukushima's waters is quite low."

On August 24th, the Tokyo Electric Power Company processed ocean water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and began draining it into the ocean.

The following day, Japan's Environmental Ministry took water from the Fukushima prefecture to measure the concentration of tritium and other radioactive chemicals. They examined the ocean water in 11 locations including places close to the drainage and those as far as 25 miles away. On the 27th, they declared that the concentration of 1 liter of tritium was below ten becquerels in each location. Ten becquerels was the lowest possible concentration they could inspect at the time.

Cabinet Minister Nishimura said, "We have confirmed there is no harm towards people or the environment." The Ministry will continue to check the ocean water once a week while uploading the results to their website and social media.

The Japanese Fisheries Agency also inspected fish caught near the nuclear power plant on the 26th. A representative stated that the concentration of tritium was so low that they were unable to examine it. The agency will also continue inspections from henceforth.

#Notes
The localized name of "福島第一原子力発電所" is "Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant."

Miles is used in American English instead of kilometers. The original article mentions 40 kilometers in the second paragraph, which is approximately 24.8548 miles.
