Translation is rarely taught in foreign-language studies in the United States.
Former methodology emphasized acquiring reading through vocab and grammar, then transitioned into interpretation.

The **grammar-translation method** gained popularity in the early 19th century but was judged defective because it:
- "ignores the spoken language"
- "creates false notions of semantic equivalence across languages"
- "deals with isolated, unconnected sentences rather than coherent texts"
Howatt and Widdowson 2004: 151-2, 189, 191-2

Negative criticism was also drawn for "strengthening first language (L1) *interference*, i.e. inducing errors due to the superimposition of L1 structures on the second language (L2)"
Gatenby 1952: 21-2; Lado 1964: 40, 217
